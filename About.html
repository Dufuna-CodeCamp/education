		<h3><u>Our Story</u></h3><br>
		<p><small>Over three decades of experience in preparing young adults for their careers and/or further study. Ednology College began in 1987 in the very heart of Lekki, Lagos. The College places great value on character and moral education as well on academics achievements.</small></p> <br>
		<h3><u>Our Mission</u></h3><br>
		<p><small>We are goal-oriented and strive for continuous improvement in teaching and learning.

We value not only academic success, but we also encourage talents of all kinds whether in the arts, drama, music or sports. Our view is that a kind, respectful and helpful student, who has a positive attitude to school life and fellow students, is every bit as worthwhile as the brilliant scholar, artist or athlete.</small></p> <br>
